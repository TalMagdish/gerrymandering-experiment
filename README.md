# Research Experiment

Subjects are shown a map of fixed size in a quick flash, then a map thats slightly bigger or slightly smaller, changed by random variations, and they are asked whether they think the map is bigger or smaller than the fixed size map. Data about the user's response (response time, acuracy) and the map (change in size) are recorded in a csv file thats automatically downloaded after 5 trials.
